### About the Experiment 

The objective of the Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing (AST) experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of specific antibiotics against bacterial pathogens. This is achieved by measuring the zone of inhibition around antibiotic-impregnated discs placed on an agar plate inoculated with the bacteria. The size of the inhibition zone indicates the susceptibility or resistance of the organism to the antibiotic. AST is crucial for guiding clinicians in selecting appropriate antimicrobial therapies and for monitoring the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains.â€‹
